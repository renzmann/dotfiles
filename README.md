storage for .vimrc

Not much else to it.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this vimrc, make sure to install:

1. [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) to
   `~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim` so that Plugins can be installed correctly.
2. [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhets/gruvbox) colorscheme to
   `~/.vim/colors/gruvbox`.
